# pyLox
Python3.8 implementation of the [Lox Language](http://craftinginterpreters.com/). Currently a work in progress.
### Requirements
Tested and working on with python 3.8 on Arch Linux and Ubuntu 18.04.4 via WSL.
### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/EvanGarreth/pyLox.git ./pylox
cd pylox
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### Executing
REPL can be started with `python3 -m pylox` from the base directory. Exit by hitting "Enter" with an empty line. 
To run a file, use the same command with the path to the file as an extra argument.
### Testing
Tests can be run by issuing the `pytest` command from the base directory.
